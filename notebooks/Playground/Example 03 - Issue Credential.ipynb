    "## Issue Credential\n",
    "\n",
    "Issuing a credential involves establishing a connection between the issuer and the holder, which is done by following the process outlined in `Example 01 - Connections`. Once the connection is established, the issuer will prepare and send a credential offer, which creates an issue record on both the issuer's and holder's agents. The holder will then retrieve the list of issue records, find the one they wish to accept, and notify the issuer of their acceptance. Finally, the issuer will issue the credential to the holder, completing the process.\n",
