    "## Present proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting a proof involves establishing a connection between the issuer and the holder, which is done by following the process outlined in `Example 01 - Connections`. Once the connection is established, the verifier will prepare and send a proof request, which creates a presentation record on both the verifier's and holder's agents. The holder will then retrieve the list of presentations, find the one they wish to accept, and notify the verifier of their acceptance. The accept proof message contains an id of a credential stored in the Holders Agent. Finally, the Verifier will receive the proof from the holder, completing the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the terminology \"proof request\" and \"presentation request\" may be used interchangeably \n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Important Note \n",
    "Please run *Example 03 - Issue Credential* before continuing with this example. "
