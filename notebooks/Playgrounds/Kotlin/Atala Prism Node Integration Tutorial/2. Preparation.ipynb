    "# Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains how to integrate the **Atala PRISM SDK** into a **Kotlin** project using the **Gradle Build Tool**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This tutorial assumes proficiency in setting up/working with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) projects. Create a new project or open an existing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth saying that the examples use the `runBlocking` clause to make the examples simpler (i.e. not having to worry about coroutine contexts). If **Kotlin** is used as integration there is no need to use `runBlocking` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to consume SDK API, you need to install [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html). For managing multiple Java versions we recommend you to try [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting required libraries\n",
    "You can add SDK modules to your project by downloading them from the GitHub Packages. See the next section for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding dependencies to Gradle\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating (or opening) the **Gradle** project, add the necessary dependencies to your `build.gradle`:\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "// needed for cryptography primitives implementation\n",
    "implementation(\"io.iohk.atala:prism-crypto:$VERSION\")\n",
    "// needed to deal with DIDs\n",
    "implementation(\"io.iohk.atala:prism-identity:$VERSION\")\n",
    "// needed to deal with credentials\n",
    "implementation(\"io.iohk.atala:prism-credentials:$VERSION\")\n",
    "// needed to interact with PRISM Node service\n",
    "implementation(\"io.iohk.atala:prism-api:$VERSION\")\\n\n",
    "// needed for the credential content, bring the latest version\n",
    "implementation(\"org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.2.2\")\n",
    "// needed for dealing with dates, bring the latest version\n",
    "implementation(\"org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime:0.2.1\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, include these repositories to be able to resolve all the dependencies and set `ATALA_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to be able to access them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "repositories {\n",
    "    mavenCentral()\n",
    "    mavenLocal()\n",
    "    google()\n",
    "    maven(\"https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/\")\n",
    "    // Required for Kotlin coroutines that support new memory management mode\n",
    "    maven {\n",
    "        url = uri(\"https://maven.pkg.jetbrains.space/public/p/kotlinx-coroutines/maven\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    maven {\n",
    "        url = uri(\"https://maven.pkg.github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-sdk\")\n",
    "        credentials {\n",
    "            username = \"atala-dev\"\n",
    "            password = System.getenv(\"ATALA_GITHUB_TOKEN\")\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
