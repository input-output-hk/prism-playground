    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks a user through the necessary steps to integrate the **Atala PRISM SDK** in a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the tutorial, one should have learned all the necessary pieces to build an application like [Atala PRISM Interactive Demo Website](https://atalaprism.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided examples are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), which are using underlying JVM libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is also available in following languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Kotlin](../../Kotlin/Atala%20Prism%20Node%20Integration%20Tutorial/1.%20Introduction.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these examples is to be verbose with the hope that one will find them simple enough to create one's own abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Actors & Services\n",
    "There are 3 actors involved in the code:\n",
    "1. **Issuer** - acts as an institution that issues credentials.\n",
    "2. **Verifier** - acts as an institution that receives and verifies credentials.\n",
    "3. **Holder** - acts as a person, who wants to get a credential from **Issuer**, so that it gets validated by **Verifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the backend side, **Node** service is involved in this tutorial. **Node** implements the **Atala PRISM** protocol, which is what gets the proofs about **DIDs/Credentials** published on **Cardano** ledger, as well as allows to query such data.\n"
