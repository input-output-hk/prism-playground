    "This section explains how to prepare the environment to use the **Atala PRISM SDK**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any compatible operating system to use required tools & instruments\n",
    "- At least 40 MB of free disk space for Atala PRISM SDK libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tools & Instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)\n",
    "- [Python >= 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n",

    "For managing multiple Java versions we recommend using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/).\n",

    "## Adding dependencies\n",
    "You can add SDK modules to your project by downloading them from the GitHub Packages. See the next section for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to download packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get Atala PRISM SDK GitHub authentication token from Atala team\n",
    "2. Export `ATALA_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with authentication token value\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use the following snippet to export a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux/MacOs\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export ATALA_GITHUB_TOKEN=\"ghp_...\"\n",
    "\n",

    "Windows\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting required libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Python wrapper for **Atala PRISM SDK**, it is required to download all dependencies first.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to do so is to use Atala PRISM CLI dependencies as it contains all required JAR files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download them, please, use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl \"https://maven.pkg.github.com/input-output-hk/atala-prism-sdk/io/iohk/atala/prism-cli/v1.3.3-snapshot-1657071792-bd25a29/prism-cli-v1.3.3-snapshot-1657071792-bd25a29.zip\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer ${ATALA_GITHUB_TOKEN}\" -L -O\n",

    "\n",
    "If you already set up Kotlin project using **Atala PRISM SDK**, you could also add the following task to the `build.gradle.kts` script to save all dependencies in the build directory:.\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val copyDependenciesToBuildDir by tasks.creating(Copy::class) {\n",
    "    from(configurations.runtimeClasspath.get().resolve())\n",

    "    dependsOn(tasks.build)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, save dependencies to `<project_dir>/build/dependencies` using `./gradlew copyDependenciesToBuildDir` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, set `JAVA_HOME` and `ATALA_PRISM_JARS` environment variables as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export JAVA_HOME=<java_home_directory>\n",
    "export ATALA_PRISM_JARS=\"<working_dir>/prism-cli-v1.3.3-snapshot-1657071792-bd25a29/lib\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install [JPype](https://jpype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to access Java classes from Python:\n",
    "\n",
