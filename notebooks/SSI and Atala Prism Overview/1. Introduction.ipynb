    "Atala PRISM is a decentralized identity solution built on the Cardano blockchain. PRISM leverages the self-sovereign identity (SSI) concept to provide a digital credentials product that empowers users to own and control their identity and personal information, which they can share in a secure, private, and trusted way. The Atala PRISM platform allows sharing these credentials enabling a wide range of use cases across multiple verticals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this documentation, we describe the technical underpinnings of Atala PRISM by presenting its architecture and building blocks. We have used emerging standards and specifications from the W3C and DIF to build our platform. The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials Data Model specification are most notable."
