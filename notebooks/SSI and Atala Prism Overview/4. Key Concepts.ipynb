    "Atala PRISM is an open-source decentralized identity solution built on the Cardano blockchain. PRISM builds upon the concepts of Distributed, Self-Sovereign Identity (DID, SSI) and Verifiable Credentials (VC) to provide a digital credentials product that empowers consumers to own and control their identity and personal information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Atala PRISM platform enables sharing of these credentials online, offline and on-chain, enabling a wide range of use cases across multiple business sectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "### Detailed component description\n",
    "Atala PRISM consists of four major architectural layers of functionality: Decentralized Applications (dApps), Software Development Kit (SDK), Services (Internal and External), and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Each layer is subdivided into different components:\n",
    "\n",
    "> diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "## dApps Layer\n",
    "#### Mobile wallet\n",
    "The Mobile Wallet is a mobile application available for Android and iOS whose purpose is to securely store verifiable credentials and other digital assets, and enable its owner (Holder) to receive and share them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Management console\n",
    "The Management Console is a web application designed for Issuers and Verifiers. The console enables users to manage the issuance and verification of credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactive web demo\n",
    "The Interactive Web Demo (reached from atalaprism.io) enables its users to experience what a smart city powered by Atala PRISM would look like. \n",
    "The demo simulates the credential issuance process and showcases situations where issuing a particular credential requires proof of existence of another credential.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third-party dApps\n",
    "\n",
    "## SDK Layer\n",
    "* Decentralized identity\n",
    "* Verifiable credentials\n",
    "* Cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "## Services Layer\n",
    "> Services layer to be described\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internal Services\n",
    "#### Layer2\n",
    "This service implements a Layer-2 protocol used by PRISM to batch transactions and provide transaction scalability and throughput. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Layer-2 service was originally based on the Sidetree protocol by the Distributed Identity Foundation (DIF), but we have extended it to support not only Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) but also Verifiable Credentials (VCs). \n",
    "\n",
    "Atala PRISM implements the third design iteration for the Layer-2 protocol. We will keep expanding its versatility to accommodate future deployment and operational use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Payments\n",
    "The Atala PRISM Payments facility will enable the processing of payments in collaboration with a third-party payment processing provider. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Payments service includes core components whose role is to provide payments by both traditional- (credit- and debit- card based) and blockchain-based (cryptocurrencies, for example) means. This service will also model respective wallets and business rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Payments service is currently in design phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connector\n",
    "The Connector service is responsible for secure, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication between PRISM users. This service is based on public-key cryptography. Peers (for instance, an Issuer of a Verifiable Credential and a future Holder of a Verifiable Credential) can only begin to exchange information after a channel has been established through the connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Note: Currently, the roles of Connector and Data Vault are merged, so that verifiable credentials are retained and can be recovered directly from the Connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encrypted Data Vault (EDV)\n",
    "The Atala PRISM Encrypted Data Vault (EDV) securely stores, retrieves, and restores credentials and other information. These operations are controlled by the owners of the information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The EDV is provided as a gRPC service with the following operations:\n",
    "* Store: Stores a given encrypted payload, associating it with the authenticated user. A unique ID is returned.\n",
    "* Get: Retrieves all encrypted payloads stored by the authenticated user, paginated and sorted by insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EDV allows the Connector service to drop long-term storage while still allowing the mobile wallets to recover their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of privacy, the EDV uses the same authorization infrastructure as the Connector, so communication is secure and the user is authenticated via its DID. On the client side, the payloads are encrypted with the user's DID, so bad actors cannot steal the information from either the wire or the server end. Because the server never actually sees raw data, there are no privacy concerns. The client can only query its own data, as the server filters payloads implicitly by the authenticated user. When a user queries for their payloads, only encrypted data will be returned and the client will need to decrypt them locally to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## External Services\n",
    "#### Oracles\n",
    "The Oracles service will interface with the rest of PRISM either through its SDK or directly through smart contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Oracles service is currently in design phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KYC\n",
    "A KYC service is responsible for implementing a KYC process.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: KYC service is currently in design phase..\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)\n",
    "This is both our trust anchor and a major provider of extended functionality, where applicable. For Bitcoin, we leverage its ability to store transaction metadata (through OP_RETURN), thus using it as a timestamping (or proof-of-ownership) service. Cardano, a more advanced blockchain, now provides us with metadata and will soon enable Smart Contract and Native Tokens capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "PRISM interfaces with blockchains in a plug-and-play fashion through a standardized READ/WRITE interface. This effectively means that a Bitcoin-based deployment and a Cardano-based deployment are architecturally and operationally quite similar in the majority of their components. The PRISM design can accommodate other blockchains too, but Cardano and Bitcoin are our current implementations for the DLT layer."
