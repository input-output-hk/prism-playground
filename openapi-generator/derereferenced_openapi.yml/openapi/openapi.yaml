        Accepts an [Out of Band 2.0](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.0/#out-of-band-messages) invitation, generates a new Peer DID,
        and submits a Connection Request to the inviter.
        It returns a connection object in `ConnectionRequestPending` state, until the Connection Request is eventually sent to the inviter by the prism-agent's background process. The connection object state will then automatically move to `ConnectionRequestSent`.
