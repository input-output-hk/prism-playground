    "Establishing a connection between two peers, the Inviter and Invitee, begins with the Inviter creating an out-of-band (oob) invitation. This invitation contains all the necessary information for the Invitee to connect with the Inviter. Once the invitation is created, it must be handed to the Invitee in some way, such as through email, messaging or QR code. Once the Invitee receives the invitation, they must accept it to proceed with the connection. Finally, with the invitation accepted, the connection is established, allowing the two peers to communicate and share data.\n",
